React is a complex technology, and although it is easy to start using it, taking full advantage of its many features is something that takes time and, above all, practice.

This project was done hand in hand with Platzi's Advanced React course. In it, we got to know how to use all those React functions that are not so easy at the beginning, but that can be very useful when we want to take our code to the next level:

- High-order components
- Reach Router
- Custom Hooks
- Lazy load
- Render management
- Optimization
- Graphql and Apollo
- Testing

All this and more were covered in this project.
